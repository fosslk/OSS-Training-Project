## ThunderBird

Although Thunderbird development was "discontinued" back in 2012, it still receives maintenance updates so don't write it off as dead. Sure, Thunderbird may not be getting new features going forward, but it's absolutely still viable for everyday personal use.
And, as sad as it is to say, Thunderbird is the only free and open-source desktop email client that's actually worth using. Other open-source clients exist, but they're riddled with issues like clunky interfaces, glitchy performance, and a lack of advanced features.

- Provides security protection firewalls, spam filters, and anti-virus properties
- Mozilla Thunderbird is free to download on any operating system.
- Thunderbird can be used for any operating system
- Let’s you reads RSS feeds like streams of email with filter, search and labeling
- Thunderbird gets rid of junk mail precisely using Bayesian filtering and detects scams

### Disadvantages

- RSS feed reader could be integrated better and offer more power for Thunderbird
- Mozilla Thunderbird could be more helpful by suggesting tags or reply text
- Not so easy to include configuration of a number of security features.
 
## Roundcube
 
It is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an application-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect from an email client, including MIME support, address book, folder manipulation, message searching and spell checking.
You are probably familiar with the various free web based email solutions that are available today. Services like Yahoo Mail, Outlook.com and Gmail are used by millions of people all over the world. Such services are great for personal email, but what about business emails? Many businesses have their own domain name, website and maybe even a e-commerce solution. Business email addresses tend to use the company’s domain name rather than @outlook.com or @gmail.com etc. So Bob Smith, the accountant at  Sporty Shoe Warehouse, would probably have the email address “smith@ssmith.com” or some variation of that.
 
### Advantages

- Multilingual capabilities
- Find-as-you-type address book
- Extensible using the Plug-in API
- Security and Privacy Protections

### Disadvantage

- Not very much mobile friendly
- For search there is no reverse index
- Extremely clunky unintuitive interface
