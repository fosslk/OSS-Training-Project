# Introduction to LibreOffice

LibreOffice is a software bundle that functions as a free office suite. LibreOffice is built and maintained by the governing body of nonprofit organization The Document Foundation. Libre Office Operates as a free and open-source project accepting a multitude of inputs from multitude of developers from around the world. 

Motivated by the principles of Free Software the Document Foundation takes procedures to make sure their work is accessible in non-restrictive manners. The four essential freedoms ensure the non-restrictive nature. 

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.

- The freedom to study how the program works and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.

- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

The belief that freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, and change or improve is a user’s right has pushed the organization to build a project that is ever so growing and scaling. 

LibreOffice as an office suite has a lot of competition as there are many major players who provide Office Suite solutions. LibreOffice modules support many productivities related tasks and aims to provide the best user experience and its support and the community makes sure that user needs are met. 

Moving forward let’s take a look at an overview of their popular Libreoffice modules.

# Libre Office Writer

## What is LibreOffice Writer? 

LibreOffice Writer is a word processor software which comes bundled with the LibreOffice suite. 

Libre Writer is open-source software, and it is free. Writer Consists of all features necessary to produce professional documents to infographics. And due to features and support Writer has been widely adopted in many institutions who take their documents seriously. 

## Usage and Components

- ### Title Bar

This is the most common element to any other program we might have on our computers. This bar represents the document name and the window functions such as close, minimize and maximize. 

- ### Document Layout (Workspace) 

Once the program is launched the majority of the workspace is allocated to the document layout. This is a white page which represents your working document. In addition to the document there is also a ruler which comes along which gives the measurements and dimensionality of the document. This workspace is really important as it displays how the final document is going to turn out which is referred to as WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get). 

- ### Menu Bar and toolbars 

Next, we see there are a lot of different buttons and sliders in the top of the screen after the title bar. This would be the Tools that come with libre for formatting documents. This section has particularly three elements attached together: menu bar, standard toolbar and formatting toolbar. Menu bar contains variations of toolbars with tools necessary for a particular typography operation. Each tab in the menu. For example, if you are not happy with how your text in the document looks or you want to add some flare into the text you can change the font used in the document with the help of features available in the toolbar. And it is not just limited to making things look good, let say you want to add formulas to your documents that can be done with the insert formula function available in the insert tab. 

- ### Side Bar 

Next to the right we have the sidebar which is another segment which uses something most of you all might call as the hamburger menu. This menu is extending the toolbars and allows even more fine tuning the formatting operations. So let's take the example of changing paragraph line spacing now while this can be done with a dropdown menu if what to set a extract value traditional approach was to open a separate window which gave the feature to set our own spacing values now this seems a bit inconvenient and this takes our view away from the document hence the addition of this side bar mitigates opening a new window. Most of the extended features are packed away in the side. And don’t worry you even minimize the sidebar so you can focus on the document. 

- ### Status bar 

Finally, we see a small section at the very bottom which displays some information. Let’s see what all this is about. Now most of the documentation workflows deal with a multitude of pages and it's not just one page so there is an indication which mentions which page you are working on. And there are also indicators to let the user know about the number of characters and the number of words. And moving to the left there is a slider in the bar which allows you to zoom in and out. So, you can closely inspect what the document will look like. 
###

- ### File Formats and Exporting 

So let’s talk about file formats, specifically related documents. When it comes to productivity software suites there are many players and among them each of these programs have their own way of producing final work. When it comes to libre has adopted open standards in this case the writer has adopted the default file format known as OpenDocument Text (ODT). While Writer supports other major formats, their writer will best work with open standards. 


## Features 

- Document writing 

Writer supports a variety of text inputs ranging to a diverse range of languages and all the text can be rendered then and there. 

- Spell and Grammar Checker 

Writer comes built in with a spell and grammar checker which allows reviewing the document. And more language packages can be installed into the spell and grammar checker. 

- Forms

Built in form generators can quickly aid you in setting up forms in the document. 

- Built in Drawing and Graphics 

Adding Graphics like icons to simple drawings is built in. 

- Calculation and Equation Functions 

Dealing with numbers is handled with a range of functions and display features which allows to process calculations and formatting related numbers. And Writer has built in facilities to insert scientific equations as per the standards have stated. 

- Export PDF. 

`	`With wide range of export formats available there is support for portable document 

format.

- Content Separation and Table Generation (eg : Index, bibliography) 

Complex documents extending multiple chapters can utilize the table generators to add tables with hyperlinks.

- Digital Signing

Writer supports user input which can be converted to digital ink. Enabling Digital Signatures. 

- Mail Merge

Libre Calc

What is Libre Calc?

LibreOffice Calc is the spreadsheet component of the LibreOffice software suite. Libre Calc allows us to organize, analyze and store data in a tabular form. With its comprehensive range of advanced features, Libre Calc is considered a very efficient tool by professional data miners and statisticians. 

Usage

- Spreadsheet layout

The main section of the workspace in Calc displays the cells in the form of a grid. Each cell is defined by the intersection of one column and one row in the spreadsheet. At the top of the columns and the left end of the rows are a series of header boxes containing letters and numbers. The column headers use an alphabet character starting at A and go on to the right. The row headers utilize a numerical digit, starting from 1 and go down.


- Name box and Formula bar

The name of the active cell is displayed in the Name box. The name is formed by the letter of the column and its line number. The active cell is the one we have selected each time using the mouse or keyboard. Next to the Name Box is the Formula Bar, which displays the formula or the contents of a cell. In the Formula bar, there are buttons for inserting functions into a cell.


- Sheets bar

In Calc, you can have more than one sheet in a spreadsheet, and each sheet can have a maximum of 1,048,576 rows and a maximum of 1024 columns. At the bottom of the grid of cells is where the sheets bar is placed, which indicates how many sheets are used in your spreadsheet. Clicking on a sheet's tab enables access and displays to the workspace each sheet. An active sheet is indicated with highlight color in the sheet's tab.



- Saving and Exporting spreadsheets

Calc uses the Open Document Format with the extension \*.ods to save spreadsheets. If you need to exchange files with users using Microsoft Office, Libre Calc supports saving to Xls format. You can also export a spreadsheet to most file-formats including, CSV, PDF, and HTML.

Features


1. **Macro Programming:** Libre Calc supports Macro Programming with OpenOffice BASIC language.
1. **Change the function of the Enter Key:** If you need to keep moving right frequently, you can set the function of the enter key to move to the immediate right side cell,
1. **Freeze:** If a spreadsheet contains several columns, some can be frozen on the screen while moving/ viewing the data on the other columns. 
1. **Text Formatting:**  If you do not have the time to right-click and format the cell as text, you could enter the value with apostrophes, and the value is automatically formatted. 
1. **Auto-Fill:**  Autofill function does the following: If there is text in the first column, the value is copied to all the selected cells below it. If there is a number, then the selected cells below would contain incremental numbers. If there is a formula in the first cell, then the same formula is copied to the selected cells below with corresponding row attributes. 
1. **Deleting a cell:** When you select a cell and press delete, you are presented with options to delete either the data or the cell formatting (or) both. This is useful in some cases where you want to delete a cell containing a decimal number and enter text immediately, without having to change the format of the cell separately.
1. **Formatting Cells:** Cell formatting can do many things beyond selecting it as text, number, and dates. For example, it is possible to strike through, wrap text, and shrink the text to fit a cell size.
1. **Printing Options:** There are several options available with Libre Calc when one wants to take a print out of the spreadsheets. You can add a page break that restricts the content printed on a page; Header/footer information can be added to show data like date, name, or title on all the pages.
1. **Insert Options:** There are options to insert special characters, colored theme backgrounds, and charts (pie chart, bar chart) in a single cell. We can also insert PDFs as images, also import Apple Numbers spreadsheet documents with ease.
1. **Auto-Filter:** Filters the selected cell range and creates one-row list boxes where you can choose the items that you want to display.

# LibreOffice Base
## What is LibreOffice Base? 

LibreOffice Base is a Database Management Application which comes bundled with the LibreOffice suite. Libre Base is open-source software, and it is free. Base is a powerful desktop front end with support for multitude Database operations. Libre Base has support for all the major Database engines namely MySQL/MariaDB, Adabas D, MS Access and PostgreSQL.

## Usage and Components

When it comes to libre base there are four major work areas and namely there are Tables, Queries, Forms, Reports. Depending on the Selected Area various facilities and Tasks are presented. 

- ### Forms

Forms is the most used workspace, and this could be because of the simplicity it provides. So, to be exact a Database form is a simple window with a bunch of fields where the user can input data and trigger database operations. Forms can be used to retrieve information and where the simple data would be filled appropriately into places in the forms. 

- ### Tables 

Table workplace allows the user to enter data directly into the database table. This is like a big sheet with rows and columns where columns represent the database attributes and rows represent the actual data. And users can directly change the table even perform table wide mutilations. 

- ### Queries 

Queries allow the user to extract information tables. So, like earlier I said that the database is like a big sheet with rows and columns. Now let’s say we want to sort this table in alphabetical order. If we were to do that, we would need to first find the column which we would like to sort then once that is figured out, we can set up query where we can use built in operations to sort and then returning result from the query will change our view of the table and show us a table with sorted table. 

Most Database engine supported query operations are also supported in the workspace and the simple click and search simplifies most of the internal operations. This is a very useful feature that lets the user deep dive into the database. 
- ### Reports 

Reports is a neat workspace that allows the user to make hard copies of the processed data. This feature can be handy in situations like producing invoices. Where the user can access multiple data sources and produce a single printable file which can be easily understood by a person. Most of the text and the table in the document is automatically generated and the templates and be changed accordingly. 

### word about base file

Base file is a compressed set of files which consists of information about the different work areas. Unlike other files Base file has an important role and if it ever occurs when dealing with base file related tasks being extra careful will save a lot of headaches. 

Just like its siblings Libre base has also adopted open standards hence libre utilizes \*odb (Open Database) File format. 

## Features 

- Simplified Database Operations (CRUD Operations)

Libre base supports common database operations such as create, access, view, delete and these operations are much more simplified with the aid of graphical user interfaces which allows the users to conduct complex database operations without touching the internal database engine. And most of the common operations are a few clicks away. 

- Built in Software wizards

Getting things set up is simplified with the use of wizards many operations related databases require configurations and this could easily be tedious and cumbersome so with built in software wizards most of the configurations are taken care of and users can directly jump into the database. 

- Built on top of Java Runtime.

Java runtime is software environment which enables the functionality of java applications java being one of the most popular runtimes out there many of the enterprise level applications supports this runtime. Which is a huge plus as there is a rich ecosystem and many utilities and features of enterprise applications will have the ability to work with Libre Base.

- Supports Embed and external Databases. 


# LibreOffice Impress 
## What is LibreOffice Impress? 

LibreOffice Base is a presentation Application. which comes bundled with the LibreOffice suite. Being libre Impress follows the path of open-source software and it is free. Libre Impress is a feature rich application with all the bells and whistles needed for a modern-day presentation. 

## Usage and Components

When it comes to libre impress there are three main components in the application and there are four views. Let's see how these components are laid out.  

- ### Menu Bar and Toolbars 

Menu bar is at the top of the application and menus are mostly common among all the libre applications which facilitates the most common features. And Below the Menu bar we find the toolbar which consists of tools that can be used to add and change behavior of the elements of the presentation. Toolbars can be further extended depending on the task at hand. There is a Drawing toolbar which allows adding built in graphics. There is a Line and Filling toolbar which allows the usage of built-in line drawing tool. and while this may be similar to drawing toolbar here it is more concerned in primitive drawings. And finally, there is a text formatting toolbar as the name suggests it allows formatting and changing the appearance of text with a built in text rendering engine. 

- Slide’s pane 

This is the section of the windows which to the left. This Shows a small picture of each slide in the presentation (Slide Deck). These small pictures are called thumbnails, and this indicates to the user how the presentation is going to flow and how it looks. Flow of the presentation can be managed in this section where you can drag and drop or move the slides to change the flow. An entire slide can be duplicated or even deleted by using this pane. This is a quite handy tool that gives a quick overview visually. 



- Side Bar

So, this sidebar is just like what is in the libre writer. With Sectioned off like a hamburger menu. These menus are often utilized to change and fine tune any element present with the slide. Changing Color, size, orientation, and much more can be done within the side bar. This allows the user to quickly modify slides and arrange the elements as they desire on the slide without much hustle.
## Now let’s see what the default views are available with impress. 


- ### Normal View 

Normal view is the main standard view for creating presentations slide by slide. And in this view any element can be changed or modified with effects. 

- ### Outline View 

Outline view will most focus on the content on the sidles that are added as text to the slides. This view will show the slides in its sequence and topics and bullet lists, numbered lists from each slide will be listed down. Graphics and added effects will not be shown. 

- ### Notes View 

Notes are not shown when the presentation is up, and notes are shown in the presenter’s screen only where the presenter can attach content as notes to the presentation and reference material. 

## Features 

- Creating Vector Graphics

There is a built-in vector graphics in Libre Impress which enables designing and adding graphics on the slides. 

- Creating Slides

Libre Impress provides you with templates to create professional-looking slides. You can also assign a number of dynamic effects to your slides, including animation and transition effects.

- Publishing Presentations

You can publish your slides on-screen, as handouts, or as HTML documents.

- Conducting presentations

There are a variety of useful tools and well-supported mechanisms which ensures users can wrap their presentation with ease. 



# The Takeaway

LibreOffice is not limited to what was covered here. There are more and more features added everyday to this project and there are developers who build extensions which can improve the LibreOffice workflow. Undoubtedly this is a real example that showcases beauty in open source software development. 

With high competition the Document foundation has found its own community which thrives and produces. It is flexible and often appealing than paid proprietary solutions. Being Successor to the open Office Libre Office continues to be adored by the open-source communities and especially in academic institutes quite gradually but surprisingly adopts the office suite. 

Being a software package that is essential in many places making sure all the standards and the features are freely accessible for everyone is truly remarkable and with time moving it emerging new players making open projects would be pleasant and inevitable.
