## History


Nylas started an open-source desktop email client and formerly it is known as “Nylas N1”. From the January 17, 2017 release, it was rebranded as “Nylas Mail”. Nylas Mail was terminated and no longer developed after a period of time, and the code was made public under the MIT License on September 6, 2017.

One of the lead developers of Nylas Mail, Ben Gotow, started his company, “Foundry 376”. He has continued the development of the Nylas Mails on a fork named “Mailspring”. 

Many of the beneficial features that made Nylas Mail so popular have been retained in Mailspring, and core elements of the software have been redesigned to be leaner and more efficient. Nylas Mail used the resource heavy JavaScript sync engine which slowed down the app. Then, Mailspring is replaced by a new native C++ core which uses around 50% less RAM than Nylas and it helped to sync emails faster.

The first version of Mailspring is released on October 03, 2017, with version code 1.0.0. Then different versions have been released up to the current time and the latest version 1.9.2 is released on September 05, 2021.

### Components

The left sidebar of Mailspring makes it simple to obtain information at a glance. Users can view the mails, tasks, or email activity that has been done so far, which enable users to cross-reference data and prevent scheduling conflict. It includes Inbox, Unread, Starred, Snoozed, Reminders, Important, Sent Mail, Spam, Drafts and Activity navigations.

- #### **Inbox**

As Mailspring supports Unified inbox, almost all email accounts from any email provider (Gmail, iCloud, IMAP/SMTP, Office 365, Outlook.com, Yahoo) are merged into a single inbox, minimizing the need for login and logout of accounts.

- #### **Unread**

In the unread folder, only unopened emails are separated from the rest of the inboxes. It allows checking back at what happened during the last time connected and determines which emails still need to be answered.

- #### **Starred**

The star system allows the most essential emails to be highlighted, enabling the user to find them easily. The message is removed from the starred list only after the user has removed the star.

The user can set starred messages in different colors and types that labeled with a yellow star by default. A message can be starred by clicking on the star mark on the left of the message in the inbox or by clicking on the star icon in the top bar if the message is open.

- #### **Snoozed**

Mails can be temporarily removed from the mailbox and delayed until the user wants to view them again. It makes it easy to control email and manage the to-do that were supposed to be stored in the inbox.

A mail can be snoozed by selecting the time that the message needs to reappear on the window that appears after clicking on the snooze icon [🕑] at the top of the reading pane. It can be tonight, tomorrow, next week, next month, or any other time, depending on user preference. On a touch screen computer, mail can be snoozed and archived by swiping at the thread view directly.

Afterward, users can find the snoozed emails at the snoozed pane. They will appear back at the top of the inbox according to the time that the user chose, so the user is able to handle them later.

- #### **Reminders**

This option is designed to make tracking easier to remember, thus minimizing the user's ability to drop a conversation. When composing an email, Reminders can be enabled by clicking on the reminder icon and selecting the desired time. 

Then Mailspring will automatically schedule a reminder and, if no recipients reply to the relevant mail, the user will be reminded about the thread by appearing the message on the top of the inbox

All emails as well as reply mails that were successfully delivered to the relevant recipients are stored in the 'Sent Mail' folder. 


- #### **All mail**

This folder contains all emails received, successfully distributed, and pending delivery. The relevant icons indicate whether the email was sent, received or starred or important.

- #### **Spam**

Mailspring has the ability to separate unsolicited and unwanted junk emails, which are often exchanged for commercial purposes, into a separate list of spam mails, as it is harmful to store them in an informal list of recipients. The user can do this by clicking on the spam mail icon while reading a message.
User also has the ability to remove all mails from this folder By clicking ’Empty spam now’ button.

- #### **Bin**

All the trashed mails are included in this folder. Clicking on the bin icon next to the email allows the user to send an unwanted email to the bin file.

Activity folder includes a summary of analytical activity reports that have been performed on the email account over a period of time. A parametric report is created for each time a user sends mail. Activity reports are a new tool that allows to get a 'birds-eye view' of all of the   email activities. When the user views the activity report, he can select the account, and the relevant time ranges that needs to analyze at the top of the page

These data are shown in separate graphs for each activity.

- #### **Messages Received** 

This graph indicates the total number of messages received, including messages in the inbox and that are sent directly to a folder by postal rules and spam during the selected time period.

These parameters include only messages that have been sent with enabling read receipts or link tracking. User should click the ‘eye’ or ‘cursor’ icons at the bottom of the composer to enable these capabilities when sending an email.
If the user has enabled the above features, the read receipts and link tracking section can be seen as follows. If those features are disabled then the relevant data is displayed as 0%.

▪ Opened: The percentage of emails with at least one open divided by the total number of emails sent with read receipts.

▪ Clicked: The percentage of emails with at least one link clicked, divided by the total number of emails sent with link-tracking enabled.

You can set up multiple accounts from multiple email providers

When you set up an account, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to build a complete cache of your mailbox. However, Mailspring is designed to pull recent messages first, so you should be able to get going quickly. Total sync time will be dependent on factors like total number of messages, your network bandwidth, processing power, and your email provider’s throttling.

Mailspring allows you to configure auto-CC and auto-BCC, so you can sync emails you send to another service, submit them for compliance review, or enable custom workflows.
To switch between CC and BCC, click the “BCC” dropdown. To add multiple email CC / BCC recipients, separate them with commas in the text field.

When you start composing a new email from this account, or reply to an email using this account, your message will be pre-populated with the address(es) you listed in the CC or BCC field. If you need to send a particular email without the automatically copied recipients, simply delete them from the CC / BCC fields in the message composer box.
