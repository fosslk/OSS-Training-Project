# Ubuntu Operating System

# Introduction

**Ubuntu is an operating system that is developed by a worldwide community of programmers as well as by employees of Ubuntu's commercial sponsor,[ ](http://www.canonical.com/)[Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/). Ubuntu is based on the concept of free or open-source software, meaning that you do not pay any licensing fees for Ubuntu, and you can download, use, and share the operating system free of charge.**

**Being a Linux-based operating system, Ubuntu has a well-deserved reputation for stability and security. Historically, Linux has proven itself to be a workhorse server operating system, and this is where, up until now, it has been most widely used and best known. As of June 2007, 78 percent of the world's top 500 supercomputers were running Linux, according to[ ](http://www.top500.org/)[Top500.org](http://www.top500.org/).**

**However, in recent years, Linux has also become viable on desktop and laptop computers, making it an option for individuals and businesses. Ubuntu is generally acknowledged to be the most widely used version of Linux available, and Mark Shuttleworth, the founder and CEO of Canonical, estimates Ubuntu has between six and eight million users. Because the software is free to download and share, it is difficult to track exact usage numbers.**

 # Why is Ubuntu the most popular open-source OS?


- Ubuntu has always been free to download, use, and share. It is a typical example of an Open source product. Ubuntu is one of the most secure operating systems with a built-in firewall and virus protection software.

- The OS has multiple flavors that each have a large community.

- Ubuntu is visually stunning, and you can customize your interface if you want to. The latest version uses the GNOME desktop environment, which allows you to personalize virtually every single element of your UI/UX, from your notification sounds, popup style, fonts, system animations, and workspaces.

- Ubuntu offers thousands of apps available for download. Most are available for free and can be installed with just a few clicks.

- Easy installation and free Because Ubuntu and many of the applications it runs are free, millions of people wherever they are in the world can use affordable computers that run not just an efficient OS, but also properly-developed applications. Many schools can’t afford Windows computers —let alone Windows 10. These and other institutions can quickly resort to the beautiful open-source Linux distro without the fear of losing productivity, beauty, or efficiency.

- Long Term Support (LTS) Ubuntu users have the advantage of opting for LTS, which essentially means that they will continue to receive kernel upgrades and other embellishments for five years and some more.

- It’s built-in firewall and virus protection software, Ubuntu is one of the most secure operating systems around.

- Ubuntu with Windows (dual boot), Dual-booting enables you to go from a powered-off state to a menu where you can choose which operating system to load. This menu may have one, two, or even more options, and each choice loads the environment, drivers, and system necessary for the selected option.

# Straight Forward UI

One of the worst nightmares for a new Linux user who has recently moved to Linux is that Linux is known for having a hobbyist ecosystem where the end-user is the one who does all the customization and tweaking. Although the developers and the Linux community, in general, tend to prefer the flexibility of this, regular users are ought to run into trouble for having less consistency across the ecosystem and for not having an authentic user interface.

This is where Ubuntu comes in. Canonical's Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian with releases for almost all the major platforms such as Desktop, Server, IoT platforms, and Mobile. For the longest time, Ubuntu has been holding the title for being the most user-friendly Linux operating system for newcomers without any knowledge of the Linux ecosystem due to its straightforward user interface.

Ubuntu relies on the GNOME desktop environment for its appearances and can be further tweaked to match end-users preferences. Even though it is easy to use, it may not prove to be a familiar user interface if you’re coming from a Windows platform. In that case, you can try out some official flavors of Ubuntu like Kubuntu, Lubuntu to get a Windows-like user interface. Ubuntu also comes pre-installed with essential tools to get a head start.

In conclusion, Ubuntu is the best solution for anyone who wants to get into the world of free and open-source culture and not miss anything in the process. Ubuntu, of course, managed to "simplify" the experience of Linux years ago and that is why it is still so popular right now, even with many impressive Linux distributions available.

# Tons of Ubuntu flavors

**What are Ubuntu Flavors?**

Ubuntu is a free open-source operating system. It is available under the GPL license. GPL license allows us to modify, strip down, build upon, extend, and embed any part of Ubuntu. It also allows us to distribute the original Ubuntu with those changes or modifications. A customized or modified version of the original Ubuntu is known as the Ubuntu Flavour.

There two types of Ubuntu flavors; official and unofficial. The differences between official Ubuntu flavor and unofficial Ubuntu flavor are the following.

- Official flavors are customized by the same company which develops the original Ubuntu while unofficial flavors are customized by third parties or communities.

- Same as the original Ubuntu, official flavors are also distributed under the GPL license. Unofficial flavors may or may not be available under the GPL license.

- Official flavors are customized based on the general requirements while unofficial flavors are customized based on the particular requirements of the company or community which customizes them.

- Official flavors are available to download and use for everyone. Unofficial flavors may or may not be available for everyone. The company or community, which customizes them, decides whether they will be available for everyone or not.

# Low system requirements. 

The recommended minimum system requirements for the desktop edition of the latest release in 20.04 LTS(Long Term Support)

- 2 GHz dual-core processor
- 4 GiB of RAM
- 25 GB of hard-drive, USB stick, memory card, or external drive space
- VGA capable of 1024x768 screen resolution
- a CD/DVD drive or a USB port for the installer media
- Internet access is desirable, but not essential

If you have an old or low-spec computer or want to get the most out of your hardware, using a medium-lightweight desktop system such as Xubuntu or a lightweight such as Lubuntu is recommended, as they make more efficient use of your system's resources. Of course, even if you have the newest equipment out, you could still use these two. If your system has less than 768 MiB of system memory, use the Alternate Installation CD (Lubuntu 18.04 LTS). With Lubuntu 18.04 LTS and before, you could use computers with even less memory, but with the newer LXQt desktop the Lubuntu team stopped providing minimum specifications so whilst it's still light, older hardware is no longer the primary focus of Lubuntu. Ubuntu 18.04 flavors are the last supported releases for x86 (32-bit i686) computers.

# Installation

### Boot from DVD

It’s easy to install Ubuntu from a DVD. Here’s what you need to do:

1. Put the Ubuntu DVD into your optical/DVD drive.

1. Restart your computer.

As soon as your computer boots you’ll see the welcome window.

![Welcome window|602x417](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d2qhpbgLT6d_rZ76FJwSjXCt8RiLxtqR4WWW_4ZctBZRk3Uz_nYZG6Rs-qdyR42qRifvg6kcXWUv_WKN4Ak0UvXY6oe8eN2WrO9qcoCSpCV6YKg2Hxra0d67NNeHk68Cs_3qY_Xw)

From here, you can select your language from a list on the left and choose between either installing Ubuntu directly or trying the desktop first (if you like what you see, you can also install Ubuntu from this mode too).

Depending on your computer’s configuration, you may instead see an alternative boot menu showing a large language selection pane. Use your mouse or cursor keys to select a language and you’ll be presented with a simple menu.

Select the second option, ‘Install Ubuntu’, and press return to launch the desktop installer automatically. Alternatively, select the first option, ‘Try Ubuntu without installing’, to test Ubuntu (as before, you can also install Ubuntu from this mode too).

A few moments later, after the desktop has loaded, you’ll see the welcome window. From here, you can select your language from a list on the left and choose between either installing Ubuntu directly or trying the desktop first.

### Boot from USB flash drive

Most computers will boot from USB automatically. Simply insert the USB flash drive and either power on your computer or restart it. You should see the same welcome window we saw in the previous ‘Install from DVD’ step, prompting you to choose your language and either install or try the Ubuntu desktop.

If your computer doesn’t automatically boot from USB, try holding F12 when your computer first starts. With most machines, this will allow you to select the USB device from a system-specific boot menu.

*“F12 is the most common key for bringing up your system’s boot menu, but Escape, F2 and F10 are common alternatives. If you’re unsure, look for a brief message when your system starts - this will often inform you of which key to press to bring up the boot menu.”*

### Prepare to install Ubuntu

You will first be asked to select your keyboard layout. If the installer doesn’t guess the default layout correctly, use the ‘Detect Keyboard Layout’ button to run through a brief configuration procedure.

After selecting *Continue* you will be asked *What apps would you like to install to start with?* The two options are ‘Normal installation’ and ‘Minimal installation’. The first is the equivalent to the old default bundle of utilities, applications, games, and media players — a great launchpad for any Linux installation. The second takes considerably less storage space and allows you to install only what you need.

Beneath the installation-type question are two checkboxes; one to enable updates while installing and another to enable third-party software.

- We advise enabling both Download updates and Install third-party software.

- Stay connected to the internet so you can get the latest updates while you install Ubuntu.

- If you are not connected to the internet, you will be asked to select a wireless network, if available. We advise you to connect during the installation so we can ensure your machine is up to date

![Select install size, updates, and third part software|602x365](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/F18-0-iAItRC8n3cBMbGodND47mzGEo598_qFxYor5b38lRNTaR4lCmqzVxJDnyTmwNMCeUUuFK0Jd68_rmM3_POmYZknF_lACvDKRbISNLLSWYXpigr07j4iFQ0o9uTYuFTdeAC)

### Allocate drive space

Use the checkboxes to choose whether you’d like to install Ubuntu alongside another operating system, delete your existing operating system and replace it with Ubuntu, or — if you’re an advanced user — choose the ’**Something else**’ option.

![Set up storage configuration|602x369](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dt9iOiVKMJ9ICEGYF0owBik-QXX6PVxqgEpldtxbSvI00OhH5E7KuRK2W67unu51OF-TXfsr6Bvdvudcs5Yk07D6yOqx1i2TCysROTj9QT2cLJh_N71vWsRRUsUoWdApdlFfowTm)



: Options related to side-by-side installation or erasing a previous installation are only offered when pre-existing installations are detected.

### Begin installation

After configuring storage, click on the ‘Install Now’ button. A small pane will appear with an overview of the storage options you’ve chosen, with the chance to go back if the details are incorrect.

Click Continue to fix those changes in place and start the installation process.

![Write changes to disks|602x365](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uKoeUSWeJ6A2n6iaTqntGpB5xvd98N8ij0AJj63BvPy1dBpob7PcjzVxf-lgGAbiHzHqX7vcpBi96aHBlNGt-oc3LYO8GnhiZLo5PFfLkjrtbr--LdiXJ5q8Q1OaY7tzrpcEEdSS)

### Select your location

If you are connected to the internet, your location will be detected automatically. Check your location is correct and click ’Forward’ to proceed.

If you’re unsure of your time zone, type the name of a local town or city or use the map to select your location.

![Where are you|602x365](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hWcbcbZQybd6I8MBF-76jgyDQ0jdC6Pit6zqfGdzMIlY8mPJVil3FMF9rTg1ZsX6d4eot7Iwurxi3MS8Eta2E2KsK4d0fAclCOCWGYO51xQ-b1oNih5BRRnAgzElwLC6M-pzbkfG)


: If you’re having problems connecting to the Internet, use the menu in the top-right-hand corner to select a network.

### Login details

Enter your name and the installer will automatically suggest a computer name and username. These can easily be changed if you prefer. The computer name is how your computer will appear on the network, while your username will be your login and account name.

Next, enter a strong password. The installer will let you know if it’s too weak.

You can also choose to enable automatic login and home folder encryption. If your machine is portable, we recommend keeping automatic login disabled and enabling encryption. This should stop people from accessing your personal files if the machine is lost or stolen.

![Username and password entry|602x369](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/v4KHSuC8816gMlCJjPn8wgmW6naCffhOgDtly6iAGo9DjNz00jiTpnUwS1dZOTB8u7mZ00AuxUm270s-2Kb0IsAeA4wriH_Zch4lPSjgeJfbGq5HcKomy46BOt5eo_sOLv093cq1)

: If you enable home folder encryption and you forget your password, you won’t be able to retrieve any personal data stored in your home folder.

### Background installation

The installer will now complete in the background while the installation window teaches you a little about how awesome Ubuntu is. Depending on the speed of your machine and network connection, installation should only take a few minutes.

![Installer running in the background|602x448](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ArOpHqjdGuIuR8caChXCUND1SOhWjQIAkJsEp-rNix7xbchhqEx3EZONkdfDbNFF2szDokkq_xmBKj9tMLw47mkirelJoOCrb1GjrSVxhh0rJM7IlsYNwAg4Z6v_qVDQWbHj9Mmb)

### Installation complete

After everything has been installed and configured, a small window will appear asking you to restart your machine. Click on Restart Now and remove either the DVD or USB flash drive when prompted. If you initiated the installation while testing the desktop, you also get the option to continue testing.

![screenshot|602x156](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hjJZpLNlEYHXvdmrEOAB0ptYvuWYCnOnUOpf9Loo1hUAkKWtfVz57cBXhCgzrFC4SPn3k5AtZY5mGFTnp8neOwXg96HN_7fK972Kw82WnOwpkhUTvS3Wgh7OdbYjVXgkcq4g9REd)
