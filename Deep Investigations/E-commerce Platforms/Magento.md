## History of Magento

The Magento ecommerce platform is regarded as one of the most prestigious platforms for ecommerce developers worldwide.
In fact, the term Magento is more frequently searched for than the term ecommerce. This demonstrates the platform's influence. However, Magento's history is not linear. In just 12 years, the open-source platform's development, partnerships with eBay, and eventual purchase by Adobe have garnered a lot of attention for the company.
It began as a project for Roy Rubin's company Varien and has grown over the years to be one of the most adaptable ecommerce platforms on the market.

- While attending UCLA, Roy Rubin and Yoav Kutner start a project called Varien.

- Rubin began placing ads on Google Adwords in 2007, after seeing a vacuum in the market through competitor osCommerce, and earned a substantial contract. This investment allowed for the creation of what would become the Magento framework.

- In 2008, Varien published their first product under an open source license. Magento was named after the color magenta, which appeared in the original logo. Because the domain Magenta.com was already taken, they chose the more'masculine' form of Magento.com.

- The open source platform known as Magento Community Edition developed in popularity quickly due to its extremely flexible nature. It had surpassed its predecessor, osCommerce, in popularity by early 2009.

- Around 2010, the company name Varien was changed to Magento because the platform was more recognizable than its parent firm.

- In February 2011, it was disclosed that eBay had made an investment in Magento in 2010, amounting to a 49 percent ownership stake in the company. In June 2011, eBay announced that it will buy the entire firm. eBay, as the owner of PayPal, then integrated PayPal directly into the Magento platform.

- The first Magento Imagine Conference was held in 2011 in Los Angeles. The event brought together Magento Developers as well as over 600 Magento merchants and partners. Since then, the conference has taken place every year, with Magento Imagine 2018 taking place in Las Vegas.

- Magento was spun out as an independent company by the new owner Permira private equity fund in November 2015, following the split of PayPal from eBay in 2015.

- Magento Enterprise Edition, a platform as a service (PaaS), was introduced in 2016. It shared the same fundamental source as the Magento Community Edition, but it was built for large organizations that require expert assistance with installation, usage, configuration, and troubleshooting.

- The Community and Enterprise Editions were renamed Magento Open Source and Magento Enterprise respectively in 2017.

- Adobe announced in 2018 that it would acquire Magento for $1.68 billion with the intention of merging it into Adobe Experience Cloud, its Enterprise CMS platform. The transaction was completed in June 2018.

- Adobe released Magento 2.3 in October 2018, allowing customers to link their Magento stores with Amazon as well as integrate their product catalog with Google Merchant Center and Google advertising channels.

- Adobe integrated Magento Commerce Cloud and the Adobe Experience Cloud in 2019. This integration, according to Adobe, enables organizations to combine end-to-end consumer experiences from creative to commerce.
